#RippleView

这个分支增加了对于圆半径的控制，可在代码中控制，也可在xml中控制。
同时我的应用【程序员计算器】便使用了这个开源项目实现Ripple效果。

View that imitates Ripple Effect on click which was introduced in Android L.

#Usage

*For a working implementation, Have a look at the Sample Project - RippleViewExample*

1. Include the library as local library project.

2. Include the RippleView widget in your layout.

    <com.indris.material.RippleView
            android:id="@+id/btn"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent"
            ripple:alphaFactor="0.7"
            ripple:rippleColor="#58FAAC" >
    </com.indris.material.RippleView>
    
3. In your `onCreate` method refer to the View and add 'OnClickListener' for the same.

        
    	mButton = (RippleView) findViewById(R.id.btn);
        mButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
			
			@Override
			public void onClick(View v) {
				//your code
			}
		});
       
#Customization

There are three attributes which are applicable to `RippleView`.

  * `rippleColor` Color of the Ripple
  * `alphaFactor` Opacity of the Ripple
  * `hover` Hover effect on the button
  
  * You can also set these attributes from your java code by calling `setRippleColor(rippleColor, alphaFactor)` and `setHover(enabled)` respectively.
